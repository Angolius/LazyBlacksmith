    <strong>Change 01/01/2020:</strong> Since this date, the migration folder have changed (due to all errors, it was easier to remake it from scratch).
    <br>
    If you already used the application and need to upgrade, please edit your `alembic_version" table, and set the "version_num" column to "1". This will allow you to use the new migration scripts.
